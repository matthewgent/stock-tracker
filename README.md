# Stock & Wealth Tracker

## Description
A webapp that could download worldwide stock and currency data from third party APIs and then use it to provide users with an up-to-date value of their portfolio based on the shares they owned and in the home currency of their choice.

Users could also enter details of their other assets and debts so they could track their overall wealth. The system then used this figure to compare to overall official wealth statistics for their home country to show how the user was doing.

## Developer Instructions
As a developer to launch the webapp follow the standard Laravel setup instructions found here: https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation

## Maintenance
